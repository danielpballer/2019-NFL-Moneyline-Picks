## Why write functions

If you ever find yourself doing a task a second time you should write a function.  Functions are a nice way to quickly and consistently calculate something.  They also provide you a nice way of organizing your code.  This class will walk through the basics of programming functions and introduce `purrr` which enhances R's functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors.

## Functions in R

### Creating a function

Here is how you can create a basic function in R

```{r}
my_function = function(x){
  
  y = x + 2
  return(y)
}
```

I have include commands that you do not need, but they do help you keep track of what your function is doing.  Here is a breakdown of the information:

1.`my_function`:  This is the name
2. `function(x)`:  What I send to the function will be called `x` inside of the function
3. `{code}`:  This is the code the function executes.
4. `return(y)`:  This is what your function returns.

### Calling the function

To call a function, you just use the name of the function:

```{r}
my_function(2)
```

You will notice it returned `4`.

### You could also take a few shortcuts when writing functions

```{r}
my_function = function(x){
  
  x + 2
  
}

my_function(2)
```

## What about sending a lot of values:

Enter `purrr`.  In the past you may have used `lapply()` or `sapply()` but get of the bench, get in the game, and start using `purrr`.

```{r}
library(purrr)
```

### Enter `map`

The `map()` functions transform their input by applying a function to each element and returning a vector the same length as the input.

The `map()` function is `map(.x,.f,...)` for each element of `.x.` do function `.f`

```{r}
my_list = list(1,2,3)

my_list%>%
  map(my_function)
```

With `map` I sent it a list and it returned a list.

```{r}
my_list%>%
  map(my_function)%>%
  class()
```

If is send it a vector...it returns a list.

```{r}
vector = c(1,2,3)

vector%>%
  map(my_function)%>%
  class()
```

### What about returning numeric values.

`map_dbl` is like map, but it returns a `numeric` vector.

```{r}
my_list%>%
  map_dbl(my_function)
```

You get a `numeric` output.

```{r}
my_list%>%
  map_dbl(my_function)%>%
  class()
```

#### It works with lots of data types

```{r}
df = tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)

df%>%
  map_dbl(mean)
```

### Being Safe

We always need to be safe, so lets see how we can be safe with `safely`.  This example seems trivial but as you expand your understanding of `lists()` and using `map()` it will help you figure out where and why your errors are occurring.

```{r error=T}
my_list = list("string",0.1,0.2)

my_function = function(x){
  log(x)
}

my_list%>%
  map(my_function)
```

No one likes when errors occur. Now lets be SAFE!!!

```{r}
my_list%>%
  map(safely(my_function))

my_list%>%
  map(safely(my_function))%>%
  transpose()

```

## Taking a side step to get some NFL data

There is a lot going on here, so I will not go into the webscrapping.  The bottom line is, noone has created the following command: `give_me_what_I_want()`.  You will see me use `map2()`, which is explained afterwards.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(stringr)

url="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/season/"

list_pages = function(x){
  
  page = str_c(url, x, '/seasontype/2')
}

get_season_data = function(year,url){
  
  stats = url%>%
    read_html()%>%
    html_nodes(".Table__Scroller div , .Table__Scroller .Table__sub-header .Table__TH")%>%
    html_text()%>%
    matrix(ncol = 9, byrow = TRUE)%>%
    as_tibble()

  team_names = url%>%
    read_html()%>%
    html_nodes(".Table--fixed-left .Table__TD , .Table__TH div")%>%
    html_text()%>%
    as_tibble()

  season_stats = bind_cols(team_names,stats)

  colnames(season_stats) = unlist(season_stats[1,])

  season_stats%>%
    slice(-1)%>%
    write_csv(paste0("Off_Stats_",year,".csv"))
  
}

years = c(2017:2018)

years%>%
  map(list_pages)%>%
  map2(years,.,get_season_data)

# Without piping...

pages = years%>%
  map(list_pages)

map2(years,pages,get_season_data)

```

### `map2()` and `pmap()`

You also might want to send multiple lists at one time.  In the past you would have had to use multiple `for` loops.

1. `map2()` - you send 2 lists
2. `pmap()` - you send multiple lists

Above I sent `years` and `pages` to my function.

## What about mappers

A mapper is an anonymous function. That is just cool sounding for you never create the function.  Here is an example of me putting a function inside of map.

```{r}

list.files(pattern = "*.csv")%>%
  map(function(file_name){
    assign(x = str_extract(file_name,"[^.]+"),
           value = read_csv(file_name),
           envir = .GlobalEnv)
  })

```

Now here is the same thing, but without using a function inside of map but using a mapper.

```{r}
list.files(pattern = "*.csv")%>%
  map(~assign(x = str_extract(.,"[^.]+"),
           value = read_csv(.),
           envir = .GlobalEnv)
  )
```

### Just make a mapper!!!

You can also make mapper objects.

```{r}
read_my_csv = as_mapper(~assign(x = str_extract(.x,"[^.]+"),
           value = read_csv(.x),
           envir = .GlobalEnv))
```

You can use mappers instead of functions.

```{r}
list.files(pattern = "*.csv")%>%
  map(read_my_csv)
```

### Why mappers instead of functions

`as_mapper` creats mappers using `{rlang}` `as_function`  This turns your formula into a function.

If you use a defualt function in `map` you are using a mapper!
